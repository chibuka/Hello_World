# Level 01: Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to your first ninefive challenge! This is the perfect place to start your coding journey and test out our platform.

## Mission Objectives

Your task is simple: implement the `hello_world()` function to return the classic programmer's greeting.

### What You Need to Do

1. Open the `main.py` file in the project root
2. Find the `hello_world()` function
3. Make it return the exact string: `"Hello, World!"`

### Expected Output

```python
def hello_world():
    # Your implementation here
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Tips for Success

- Pay attention to **exact spelling** and **punctuation**
- The comma and exclamation mark matter!
- Test your code by running: `python main.py`

### Why "Hello, World!"?

"Hello, World!" is a time-honored tradition in programming. It's typically the first program that beginners write when learning a new language. It's simple, achievable, and gives you that first taste of success in coding.

### Testing Your Solution

Once you implement the function, you can test it by running the main file. When you're ready, submit your solution and our automated tests will verify that it works correctly.

Good luck, and welcome to ninefive! ðŸš€
