# Level 02: Welcome to ninefive! ðŸŽ¯

Great job completing Level 01! Now let's make it more personal to our platform.

## Mission Objectives

Time to show some ninefive pride! Implement the `hello_ninefive()` function to return a custom greeting for our platform.

### What You Need to Do

1. Find the `hello_ninefive()` function in `main.py`
2. Make it return the exact string: `"Hello, ninefive!"`

### Expected Output

```python
def hello_ninefive():
    # Your implementation here
    return "Hello, ninefive!"
```

### Key Requirements

- Return exactly: `"Hello, ninefive!"`
- Notice the lowercase "n" in "ninefive"
- Don't forget the comma and exclamation mark!

### What's Different?

This level tests your attention to detail:
- **Level 01**: `"Hello, World!"` (capital W)
- **Level 02**: `"Hello, ninefive!"` (lowercase n)

### Testing Your Progress

Run `python main.py` to see both levels working together:
```
Level 01: Hello, World!
Level 02: Hello, ninefive!
```

### Why This Matters

In real-world programming, small details like capitalization and punctuation can make or break your code. APIs, databases, and user interfaces all expect exact matches. This simple exercise builds that crucial attention to detail.

### Ready for More?

Once you nail both levels, you'll have proven you can:
- âœ… Follow instructions precisely
- âœ… Pay attention to details
- âœ… Work with function implementations
- âœ… Test your own code

These are fundamental skills that transfer to every coding challenge you'll face!
