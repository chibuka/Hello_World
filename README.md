# Hello World Challenge ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the **Hello World Challenge** - the perfect starting point for your ninefive journey!

## Overview

This challenge consists of **2 levels** designed to introduce you to our platform and basic programming concepts. It's beginner-friendly and focuses on:

- âœ… Following instructions precisely
- âœ… Understanding function implementation
- âœ… Attention to detail in programming
- âœ… Getting familiar with the ninefive platform

## Challenge Structure

```
Hello_World/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Your implementation goes here
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ level_01/        # Level 1: Classic "Hello, World!"
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md    # Instructions for Level 1
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_01.py   # Automated tests for Level 1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ level_02/        # Level 2: "Hello, ninefive!"
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ README.md    # Instructions for Level 2
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test_02.py   # Automated tests for Level 2
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Getting Started

1. **Read the instructions** for Level 1 in `tests/level_01/README.md`
2. **Implement the function** in `main.py`
3. **Test your solution** by running `python main.py`
4. **Submit when ready** and let our automated tests verify your work
5. **Move to Level 2** once Level 1 passes

## Quick Test

Want to see if your implementation works? Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Expected output when complete:
```
Level 01: Hello, World!
Level 02: Hello, ninefive!
```
